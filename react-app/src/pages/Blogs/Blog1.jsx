          <h2>Experience Setting Up GitHub and Publishing to Pages</h2>
          <p>The experience of setting up GitHub was not too difficult because of the step-by-step guide. I found it useful to have information organized in that way, as it made the slides easy to follow. I only had issues getting the hang of editing my website from GitHub. Additionally, publishing takes a while to appear on the website, so you have to wait a bit to see changes. Other than that, it was an enjoyable experience due to the step-by-step guide.
      </p>

          <h2>Reflection on the Readings</h2>
          <p>I enjoyed the readings. The three articles I chose were “As We May Think” at 65, “A Little History of the World Wide Web,” and “World Wide Web Consortium.” I had already read about Tim Berners-Lee and how he revolutionized the internet with his ideas of hypertext, making it a global system (Cailliau, 2021). However, I learned from the readings that it was an accumulation of contributors who created what we now know as the internet.
      </p>
      <p> These contributors included individuals like Vannevar Bush, whose paper inspired others such as Theodor Holm Nelson, who coined the term hypertext, and Doug Engelbart, who developed a prototype system with hypertext that allowed for email (Harper, 2010).
      </p>
      <p> In the readings, I noticed that Eurocentric men played a pivotal role in the creation of the internet, while women rarely featured in its development. Additionally, in the “World Wide Web Consortium” text, all the web conferences occurred in the West, indicating a strong Western influence in the creation of the internet and where these creators chose to place their emphasis. It seems that those in control of the internet were predominantly Eurocentric men.
      </p>
      <p> This observation aligns with my experience of the internet. Much of the content that is promoted seems quite Western and male-centered. Furthermore, many of those making strides in the internet today, such as app creators and those working in big tech, are men. For example, you can see content created by men being pushed online, such as male-centric movies or podcasts. In my experience, it feels as though there is insufficient emphasis on women or Africans and their roles in the internet. For instance, currently, nine out of ten CEOs in big tech are men (Law, 2024).</p>
          <h2>Interesting Things I Have Found About the History of the Web</h2>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, I was already aware of Tim Berners-Lee and his influence on the creation of the internet. However, I did not know that there are so many contributors and that its creation dates back to 1945 (Cailliau, 2021). I thought the internet was younger than this because there still seem to be a few fundamental issues with it. For example, sometimes when there is too much traffic on a website, it crashes. Additionally, I was surprised to learn that email predates the internet; I had always assumed it came after the World Wide Web was created (Cailliau, 2021).</p>

          <h2>Goals for This Course</h2>
          <p>My main goal is to learn how to develop websites and understand the relationship between UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience), as well as the fundamentals of these concepts. I would also like to learn how to create UI and UX that feels more inclusive, ensuring that my designs can be used by anyone, regardless of age, gender, or cultural background.</p>
