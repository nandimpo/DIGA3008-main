            <p>This page outlines the thinking and design principles I applied to create my website. It’s not just about how it looks, but about how it works and feels to use. Everything was intentional—even the smallest elements had a reason behind them.</p>

            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p className="p-summary">
              My goal is to have a user-friendly, accessible, and clear website that reflects who I am as a designer. I didn’t want something flashy for the sake of it. I wanted something that felt like an extension of how I think—warm, calm, intentional, and easy to understand. I kept asking myself: if someone only spent 30 seconds on my homepage, what would they take away?

            <h3>Visual Design Elements</h3>
            <p className="p-summary">
              I aim to create strong typographic hierarchy using the ‘Grown’ font for headings to convey a soft, feminine tone, and ‘Montserrat Classic’ for body text for clarity. I also maintain a limited color palette with brown (to embrace identity), orange and yellow (for warmth), and cool accents (for contrast). I experimented with layout spacing, margins, and alignment until the page started to feel like it had rhythm—not just blocks of content, but a conversation.

            <h3>Fonts – Readability and Legibility</h3>
            <p className="p-summary">
              Choosing fonts was harder than I expected. I didn’t want it to feel generic, but I also didn’t want it to be hard to read. After testing a few options, ‘Grown’ felt expressive enough to give my site character, especially in titles. It almost feels handwritten without being messy. For body copy, I stuck with something clean and versatile—Montserrat Classic. It holds up well across different devices and screen sizes, which is super important for accessibility.

            <h3>Colour Swatches</h3>
            <p className="p-summary">
              This is the full palette I used throughout the site. I wanted to stick with earthy and warm tones, mainly because I don’t see a lot of brown being used in web design, and I wanted to challenge that. I paired it with accent tones like golden yellow and dusty orange to add life and highlight areas for user attention.

            <h4>Primary Colour Palette</h4>
            <img src="/Images/Blogs/Colour palette (chosen 1).png" alt="Primary palette" width="200" />
            <p className="p-summary">
              The primary palette is warm and soft. These are the base tones I use the most—brown for depth and grounding, and muted yellows/oranges for energy and brightness. I was really cautious about making sure none of the colours felt too harsh on the eyes.
            </p>

            <h4>Secondary Colour Palette</h4>
            <img src="/Images/Blogs/Colour palette (chosen 2).png" alt="Secondary palette" width="200" />
            <p className="p-summary">
              The secondary palette helps break things up and guide attention. I mostly use these for contrast and balance—things like CTAs or hover states. It gives the layout some dimension without feeling overwhelming or disjointed.

            <h3>Final Design Sketches</h3>
            <p className="p-summary">
              These sketches were super helpful for me to think through layout without jumping straight into code. I tried a few different structures and page orders until something felt right. I didn't want every page to look the same—but they still needed to feel connected.

            <p className="p-summary">
              Content mapping helped me make sure every page had a clear purpose and that the flow made sense. I moved a few things around to make better sense of the user’s journey—from homepage to specific areas like scripts or portfolio. Every section has to earn its place and guide the visitor.

              These are the choices I made while building the final site. Some were visual, others functional, but they all came from testing, reflecting, and reworking areas that didn’t feel quite right.
